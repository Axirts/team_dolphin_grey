# How do we identify people who have been vaccinated? How do we stay afloat and survive this?

Automatically came to mind: 
    -Government workers - How many have been vaccinated?
    -AmericanCross who volunteer at certain stations.
    -Firefighters, putting out fires, sleeping in a cod together(vaccinated w/ non vaccinated), already coughing from smoke.
    -Businesses, i.e. cruise ships- Will they bother to ask?
    -Seasonal migrant farmworkers
    -Tropical storm coming, where are people gonna go for shelter? Vaccinated w/ non vaccinated? Require masks?
    -Tribal communities (urban/ rural),
      Sovereign nations are not required to send data to the State. 
      Give it to the CDC and data doesn't get sent back out. 

 Based on CDC data portal:
     -Much of the Covid data is aggregated, especially for vaccination, rather than at an individual level.
      a) Vaccination is hard, only include people who have been vaccinated. Can do a proxy dataset with nationwide demographics but might not be feasible due to time. 
    * b) Covid Case Outcome, detail severity of the issue, by choosing an outcome. 
      


# Long Haulers- Characteristics of people who experience symptoms vs people who dont  Create a model that predicts this:

Automatically came to mind: 
    - Long Haulers - Got covid and technically recovered but still experience symptoms 
    - John Hopkins, “60% of people who got covid still have heart conditions, even in people w/ mild cases. Also can cause kidney functions”
    - Chronic fatigue syndrome is huge for long haulers. 

 Based on CDC data portal:
     -No data is available.
     -Other sites include NIH, who have a 2-6 month wait for data requests.






 *Demographic data from CDC was obtained from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (CDC Covid)
